Instructions for StringPermute

1) The program expects a data.txt file with all the strings to be permuted (see data.txt for an example).
2) The console will display the total permutations and will ask for confirmation before executing.
3) Confirm by pressing "y" and then press enter.
4) After the permutation, the program will generate a results.txt containing all the possible permutations.
